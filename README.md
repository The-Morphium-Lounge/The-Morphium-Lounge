# The-Morphium-Lounge
The Unity3D VRCHAT Instance Collaboration of The Morphium Lounge.


The first steps towards being a Morphium Lounge Developer are the following. 

1. Sign up for Github, and give me your email address so I can add you to the permissions list of the zip file download, and so I can add you to the Organization.  

2. Download/Install VRCHAT Creator Companion and Blender3D. Both are Free, but the learning curves can be steep. I can offer guidance as needed. 

3. With Steps 1 and 2 in place, unzip The Morphium Lounge, and import the folder into the VRCHAT Creator Companion Project List. Open the project, which should open a correct version of Unity3D.

4. Search YouTube for Unity3D Tutorials. Practice, and share your learning journey with the Organization via a Shared Unlocked Journal.
